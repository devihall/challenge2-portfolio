This is my portfolio. https://devihall.github.io/d-hall-portfolio/

My portfolio contains my name, a avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
You can see a sample of my  applications.

When you click on the images of the applications you will be taken to that deployed application. When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices you will see a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
